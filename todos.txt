### ideas

-add helpful utility classes to docs
--.img-responsive, etc
-mixins needs some work
-list groups need some work

-header?

-diagrams - talk to nicole
--possibly steal images from the web

-have multiple pages for different sections?

-phrase "modifier classes"

// - resize typography baselines for different sized devices
// - centering using bonnie's trick? - for golden rectangle see smashingmagazine
// - .pull-center class for rows (?)
// - golden typography header line height is not a golden ratio
// - - investigate and perhaps do a golden ratio / 10 to size it nicely
// - .golden-content-1,2,3 with divs sized for multiples of ideal line width

// - integrate CPL into ideal content width
// - - see http://www.pearsonified.com/2012/01/characters-per-line.php
// - perhaps do something with three column approach created by the math below
// .make-golden-container-margin-large() {
//   width: percentage(1 / (1 + (2 * @golden-ratio)));
// }
// .make-golden-container-margin-small() {
//   width: percentage(1 / (1 + (2 / @golden-ratio)));
// }
